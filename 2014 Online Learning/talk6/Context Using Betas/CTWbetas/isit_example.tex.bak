\begin{abstract}
This paper provides the instructions for the preparation of papers
for submission to ISIT 2005 and relevant style file that produced
this page.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
The 2005 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory will be
held at the Adelaide Convention Centre in Adelaide, Australia, from
Sunday, Sept. 4, through Friday, Sept. 9, 2005.



\section{Submission and Review Process}
Papers will be reviewed on the basis of a manuscript ({\bf not
exceeding five pages, two columns, main text font size no smaller than
10 points}) of sufficient detail to permit reasonable evaluation. The
deadline for submission is {\bf January 30, 2005}, with notification
of decisions by {\bf May 15, 2005}.

The deadline and five page limit will be strictly
enforced. In view of the large number of submissions expected,
multiple submissions by the same author will receive especially
stringent scrutiny. All accepted papers will be allowed twenty
minutes for presentation.

\section{Proceedings}
This year, the ISIT proceedings will be
changing format. Accepted papers will be published in full (up to
five pages in length) on CD-ROM. A hard-copy book of abstracts will
also be distributed at the Symposium to serve as a guide to the
sessions.

The deadline for the submission of the final camera-ready
paper is {\bf 10 June 2004}. Final manuscript guidelines will be
made available after the notification of decisions.


\section{Preparation of the Paper}
Only electronic submissions in form of a Postscript (PS) or Portable Document
Format (PDF) file will
be accepted. Most authors will prepare their papers with \LaTeX. The
\LaTeX\ style file (\verb#IEEEtran.cls#) and the \LaTeX\ source
(\verb#isit_example.tex#) that produced this page may be downloaded
from the ISIT 2005 web site. Authors using other means to prepare their manuscripts should attempt to duplicate the style of this example as closely as possible.

The {\bf Abstract} section should be no more than $250$ words and
should contain no math notation. If citations are required in the abstract, they should be self-contained, e.g. Shannon, \emph{Bell Syst.\ Tech.\ J.} 1948, rather than [1]. The abstract will be published separately in the hardcopy book of abstracts.

The style of references, e.g.,
\cite{Shannon1948}, equations, figures, tables, etc., should be the
same as for the \emph{IEEE Transactions on Information Theory}. The
affiliation shown for authors should constitute a sufficient mailing
address for persons who wish to write for more details about the
paper.

\section{Electronic Submission}
The paper submission portal will be opened later this year.  Check

for detailed instructions.
